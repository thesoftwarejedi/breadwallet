toastwallet is a real standalone bitcoin client based on breadwallet (see fork).

This will be maintained as a fork, merging in the latest breadwallet bu incorporating
additional features or changes as I selfishly decide to implement.

**WARNING:** installation on jailbroken devices is strongly discouraged

Any jailbreak app can grant itself access to every other app's keychain data
and rob you by self-signing as described [here](http://www.saurik.com/id/8)
and including `<key>application-identifier</key><string>*</string>` in its
.entitlements file.
